            <h3> About R&B: </h3>
            <p>Rhythm and blues, commonly abbreviated as R&B, is a genre of popular music that originated in African
                    American communities in the 1940s.[1] The term was originally used by record companies to describe
                    recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, at a time when "urbane, rocking, jazz
                    based music with a heavy, insistent beat" was becoming more popular.[2] In the commercial rhythm and
                    blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two
                    guitars, bass, drums, one or more saxophones, and sometimes background vocalists. R&B lyrical themes
                    often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy, as well
                    as triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, economics, and aspirations.</p>
